[RAVATAR](http://ravatar.com) is a service platform designed to help users create high-quality realistic human AI avatars by leveraging state-of-the-art technologies of Generative AI and Conversational AI. 

Such AI-powered avatars can represent either a real person or a fictional character in a virtual realm while closely resembling human appearance and behavior by copying even the most subtle mimic expressions and gestures. And thanks to natural language processing and speech generation, these realistic digital human replicas can recognize, understand, and respond to human speech with a voice.

In the RAVATAR name, the letter “R” stands for:
**Realistic** - determining that AI avatars can closely mirror human appearance and behavior in a virtual environment.
**Revolution** - underlining that AI avatars signify a major shift in the way we interact with the world by creating new forms of communication between humans and machines, as well as breaking down barriers between people of different cultures or backgrounds.
**Resurrection** - emphasizing the ability to recreate deceased individuals in a virtual world as AI avatars using their personal data and past interactions.

RAVATAR’s services also include comprehensive guidance throughout the entire process of realistic AI avatar creation, customization, and integration into the required informational system for their further employment as personal or customer service assistants.
